1. Finish main functions in net.py
  - createVM
  - launchVM
  - migrateVM
  - stopVM
  - cloneVM
2. Clean up get_hypervisors and other beta stuff in net.py
3. Implement VM distribution modes. [This one is maybe a big task.]
  - Need to unify distribution modes. Maybe have a completely different
    file do this? A dictionary that points to different classes, each which
    points to a list that Mininet sets?
  - VMScheduler class, and we pass its name or something. Invoke when hv_name
    is actually None.
4. Figure out how to get this method to completely work in net.py
  - deleteVM
     - Stuff like xterms and such aren't properly shutdown until
       Mininet itself shuts down. I doubt we can just shut the entire
       thing down and there is no way to access it beforehand. Maybe
       we should have CMSComponents see this item (or just the VM).
5. Add the extra functionalities in cli.py
  - do_add
  - do_cp
6. Add aliases to cli.py (not important for now).
7. [DONE] Rewrite moveLink and such? (default interfaces when None?)
8. Figure out some stuff for the comp.py [This one is also a big task.]
  - Setting starting and stopping scripts for VMs
  - Enabling and disabling hypervisors (not complete right now).
9. Rewrite comp.py repr functions.
10. Clean up comments (a lot still refer to Mininet). This one is not important.
11. Clean up stuff (dummy?)
12. Json parsing fix (for config file).

13. Mininet updating (need to request first a push with POXSwitch onto there).
14. Mininet updating (moveLink, etc.)

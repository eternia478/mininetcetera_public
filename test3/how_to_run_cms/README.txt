Put runcms wherever you want.

Edit it to change any variables you want (folder locations).

Call it like an executable. Pass it arguments if you need.

Voila! 

Note: This thing is the same as running "sudo cms", so trying to do something
like "sudo cms --topo linear" would instead be "./runcms --topo linear" on the
command line. This automatically makes a config folder at your location or
wherever you specify it to be.

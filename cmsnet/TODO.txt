[COMPLEX]
1. Finish deleteVM
  - Stuff like xterms and such aren't properly shutdown until
    Mininet itself shuts down. I doubt we can just shut the entire
    thing down and there is no way to access it beforehand. Maybe
    we should have CMSComponents see this item (or just the VM).
2. Implement the VM script system
3. Finish implementing enabling/disabling of hypervisors
  - Maybe we should make an evictVMs function that just removes everything,
    and then have disable call this as well as disabling the hypervisor?
  - At the same time, implement hypervisor config handling.
4. Finish implementing handling of CMS messages (finish mininet_service.py)
5. Figure out a way for resumed configurations without a Topo class to restart
   all VMs and hypervisors correctly
  - We need to preserve the hypervisor identities (names), so some info must
    be preserved here.
  - Unfortunately, there is no way to know the number of switches set up or
    the topology they hold. Maybe there should be a check upon starting that
    checks this with the hypervisor configurations, and assume that any conflict
    in config info would suggest a completely new configuration for CMSnet
  - Also have --new_config ignore previous component configurations as well.
6. Make a cleaner API later.
  - Details unclear, but hopefuly more like Murphy's example.


[SIMPLE]
1. Test get_hypervisors_beta and consider making it the official version.
2. Rewrite component repr() methods and do_dump() in CLI
3. Rewrite comments and docstrings.
  - Mostly, change stuff referring to Mininet to CMSnet
4. Clean up unnecessary dummy usage in cms executable


[LATER]
1. Mininet node updating (need to request first a push with POXSwitch).
  - Note that this also includes updating clean.py and the mn executable
2. Mininet net updating (moveLink, etc.)


[INCOMPLETE]
1. Finish main functions other than deleteVM:
  - createVM
    - cli: Implement more options as input
    - net: Accept more options and handle vm_script input
    - comp: Accept vm_script as input
  - cloneVM   (net, comp)
    - net: Extract vm_script (leave complexity in comp?)
    - comp: Copy vm_script file, consider other info params in node
  - Some parts may require finishing the VM script system


[DONE]
1. Rewrite moveLink and others to get default interfaces if input name is None.
2. Add extra aliases to the CLI for each command.
3. Finish main functions other than deleteVM:
  - launchVM
  - migrateVM
  - stopVM
4. Implement VM distribution mode handling in launchVM
  - In the end, these modes did not become classes but rather methods.
5. Implement CMS message level at controller.
